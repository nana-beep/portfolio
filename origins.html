          <h1 class = "slide-number"> Ancient China: The Birthplace of Tea</h1>
          <p class = "oritext">&emsp;History of Tea: Chinese Symbol for Tea, Ch'aThe history of tea dates back to ancient China, almost 5,000 years ago. According to legend, in 2732 B.C. Emperor Shen Nung discovered tea when leaves from a wild tree blew into his pot of boiling water. He was immediately interested in the pleasant scent of the resulting brew, and drank some. Legend says the Emperor described a warm feeling as he drank the intriguing brew, as if the liquid was investigating every part of his body.</p>
          <p class = "oritext">&emsp;Shen Nung named the brew "ch'a", the Chinese character meaning to check or investigate. In 200 B.C. a Han Dynasty Emperor ruled that when referring to tea, a special written character must be used illustrating wooden branches, grass, and a man between the two. This written character, also pronounced "ch'a" symbolized the way tea brought humankind into balance with nature for the Chinese culture.</p>

          <h1 class = "slide-number">Japan: </h1>
          <p class = "oritext">&emsp;In the early 9th century, Japanese visitors to China were introduced to the values and traditions of tea. The Buddhist monk Dengyo Daishi is credited for bringing Chinese tea seeds to Japan when he returned from his studies abroad. Tea became an integral part of Japanese monastery life; monks used tea to help stay alert during meditation sessions. By the early 1300's tea gained popularity throughout Japanese society, but its early religious importance permanently colored the meaning and value the Japanese associate with tea and directly influenced the Japanese Tea Ceremony.</p>
          <p class = "oritexttitle">The Japanese Tea Ceremony<br></p>
          <p class = "oritext">&emsp;The sacred Japanese tea ceremony, called "Chanoyu", evolved in the late 15th century under the influence of the Japanese philosophies of Zen Buddhism.</p>

          <p class = "oritexttitle">China's Tea History<br></p>
          <p class = "oritext">&emsp;The popularity of tea in China continued to grow rapidly from the 4th through the 8th century. No longer merely used for its medicinal properties, tea became valued for everyday pleasure and refreshment. Tea plantations spread throughout China, tea merchants became rich, and expensive, elegant tea wares became the banner for the wealth and status of their owners.</p>
          <p class = "oritext">&emsp;The Chinese empire tightly controlled the preparation and cultivation of the crop. It was even specified that only young women, presumably because of their purity, were to handle the tea leaves. These young female handlers were not to eat garlic, onions, or strong spices in case the odor on their fingertips might contaminate the precious tea leaves.</p>

          <h1 class = "slide-number">  Russia:</h1>
          <p class = "oritext">&emsp;In 1618, the Chinese presented a gift of tea to Tsar Alexis of Russia. Everyone was curious about the new beverage and tea quickly gained popularity. A camel caravan trade route emerged to transport tea into the country. This caravan covered 11,000 miles and took nearly 1½ years to travel by camel. To keep the tea-hungry Russians satisfied, nearly 6,000 camels - each carrying 600 pounds of tea - entered Russia each year. In 1903 the camel caravan was replaced by the famous Trans-Siberian Railway, which slashed the transportation time from 1½ years to just over a week.</p>

          <p class = "oritexttitle"> The Opium Wars<br/></p>
          <p class = "oritext">&emsp;As tea consumption grew, Britain's exports could not keep up with the demand for tea imports. The Chinese were more interested in silver than in cotton, Britain's main export. Finding enough silver to trade for tea became increasingly difficult, however, so the British turned to growing opium in its large Asian colony...India. <br/>&emsp;The scheming British sent opium to China across the Indian border in exchange for silver, then traded the same silver back to China for tea. The illegal opium scheme worked until 1839 when a Chinese official sent 20,000 chests of opium to a watery grave in a sea near Canton. A year later, Britain declared war on China and China retaliated by placing a strict embargo on all exports of tea.</p>

          <h1 class = "slide-number">  Europe:</h1>
          <p class = "oritext">&emsp;The Portuguese and Dutch first imported tea into Europe in 1610...Rembrandt was just 4 years old! England's dance with tea did not start until 1662 when King Charles II married the Portuguese princess Catherine of Braganza. Britain's new Queen had always loved tea and brought with her, as part of her dowry, a chest of fine Chinese tea. She began serving the tea to her aristocratic friends at Court, and word of the exotic Royal beverage spread quickly.</p>
          <p class = "oritexttitle">Tea as a Status Symbol<br></p>
          <p class = "oritext">&emsp;As an imported luxury, only the wealthy could afford to drink tea. The least expensive pound of tea available cost the average laborer about a month's worth of wages. The lofty tea prices made tea highly fashionable and elitist. The ability to serve and drink tea with elegance and skill marked social status and indicated good breeding and intellect. To that end, many wealthy 18th century English and Dutch families had paintings made of the family having tea.</p>

          <h1 class = "slide-number">North America:</h1>
          <p class = "oritext">&emsp;It is no surprise that early North America, colonized by Europe, was a tea-drinking continent. Europe's same traditions and rules of etiquette crossed the Atlantic; Teahouses and elegant silver and porcelain tea accessories were popular in the new cities of New York, Boston, and Philadelphia.</p>
          <p class = "oritexttitle">The American Revolution<br></p>
          <p class = "oritext">&emsp;By the second half of the 18th century, tea constituted the single largest and most valuable commodity exported by Britain. The British government ordered a specific "tea tax" to capitalize off its popularity in America. Greed prevailed and the tax rate gradually reached 119%, more than doubling the initial cost of tea as it entered the American wholesale market.</p>
          <p class = "oritext">&emsp;In defiance, the American ports refused to allow any dutiable goods ashore. This resulted in the infamous Boston Tea Party, the British government's closure of Boston harbor, and the arrival of British troops on American soil.</p>
