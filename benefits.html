  <h1 class = "section">Benefits of Tea </h1>
  <p class = "pritea">&emsp;Tea has many benefits overall, but the top ten benefits are:</p>
      <ul>
        <div class = "one">
            <li><br/><h2 class = "captions">Tea contains antioxidants</h2> <br/>
                <p class = "description">&emsp;Antioxidants work to prevent the body’s version of rust and thus help to keep us young and protect us from damage from pollution. Load up on antioxidants with a white tea, which is less processed than black or green tea so it retains more beneficial antioxidants.</p>
            </li>
        </div>
        <div class = "two">
            <li><br/><h2 class = "captions">Tea has less caffeine than coffee</h2><br/>
                <p class = "description">&emsp;Herbal blends have no caffeine, while traditional teas have less than 50% of what typically is found in coffee. That means you can consume it without those pesky effects on your nervous system, says Leslie Bonci, nutritionist and owner of Active Eating Advice. If you're trying to switch from coffee to tea, try a chicory root tea like Teeccino, which has a mouth feel and flavor similar to coffee. Chicory root is also known to help reduce stress and is a prebiotic so may be helpful to your gut.</p>
            </li>
        </div>
        <div class = "three">
            <li><br/><h2 class = "captions">Tea may reduce your risk of heart attack and stroke</h2> <br/>
                <p class = "description">&emsp;“There’s a lot of literature out there on tea and heart health,” said Anna Ardine, clinical nutrition manager at Magee-Womens Hospital of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. “This is a health effect for which there is the strongest evidence.” <br/>
                    &emsp;In fact, a study published in 2016 that combined data from a host of earlier reports found a nearly 20% reduction in the risk of heart attack and a 35% reduced risk of stroke among those who drank one to three cups of green tea a day. Those who drank four or more cups of green tea daily had a 32% reduction in the risk of having a heart attack and lower levels of LDL cholesterol. Four cups of green tea may keep you running to the bathroom, but you can get the same benefit from drinking one cup of matcha tea, which is made from ground green tea leaves and is said to be the nutritional equivalent of 10 cups of regular green tea.</p>
            </li>
        </div>
        <div class = "four">
            <li><br/><h2 class = "captions">Tea may help protect your bones</h2><br/>
                <p class = "description">&emsp;Data from recent animal studies has shown that green tea may prevent bone loss. Moringa, a plant that's native to South Asia, has been known for its medicinal properties and is now quickly becoming a mainstream superfood. With more calcium than milk, as well as iron, vitamin A and K, moringa tea is a great addition to help keep those bones strong.</p>
            </li>
        </div>
        <div class = "five"> 
            <li><br/><h2 class = "captions">Tea may help with weight loss</h2><br/>
                <p class = "description">&emsp;Research on this isn’t as strong, Ardine said, adding that studies that have shown an effect have depended on consumption of large amounts of tea, often in pill form.</p>
            </li>
        </div>
        <div class = "six">
            <li><br/><h2 class = "captions">Tea may keep your smile bright</h2><br/>
                <p class = "description">&emsp;“Japanese researchers have found that tea can decrease tooth loss,” Ardine said. “It changes the pH in your mouth when you drink it and that may be what prevents cavities.” Beyond that, tea, unlike many other beverages does not appear to erode tooth enamel, Bonci said.</p>
            </li>
        </div>
        <div class = "seven">
            <li><br/><h2 class = "captions">Tea may boost the immune system</h2><br/>
                <p class = "description">&emsp;Studies have shown tea can tune up immune cells so they reach their targets quicker. Holy basil or tulsi tea has been used by Ayurvedic practitioners for centuries to help keep the immune system strong after injuries or illnesses thanks to its antibacterial, anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
            </li>
        </div>
        <div class = "eight">
            <li><br/><h2 class = "captions">Tea may help battle cancer</h2><br/>
                <p class = "description">&emsp;Studies on this are currently mixed, which means more research is needed, Bonci says. But, in the meantime, “if you’ve got a strong family history of cancer and you want to do anything you can, you might increase your tea consumption,” she added.</p>
            </li>
        </div>
        <div class = "nine">
            <li><br/><h2 class = "captions">Herbal tea may soothe the digestive system</h2><br/>
                <p class = "description">&emsp;“Herbal teas, in particular chamomile, can be good for people with irritable bowel syndrome because it is an antispasmodic,” Bonci said. “And ginger teas can calm nausea.” Get a dose of both with a ginger chamomile tea.</p>
            </li>
        </div>
        <div class = "ten">
            <li><br/><h2 class = "captions">Tea — unadulterated, that is — is calorie free</h2><br/>
                <p class = "description">&emsp;“It’s a great no-calorie alternative to water,” Bonci said. “It provides so many options for flavor and versatility. You can have it hot or cold. And you don’t have to put anything in it, though you might want to add a cinnamon stick or some ginger. That means you’re able to hydrate with something other than water alone.”</p>
            </li>
        </div>
      </ul>
