  <h2>What is tea?</h2>
  <p>For a more concrete definition, all varieties of tea are made 
    from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant.  To simplify and 
    categorize, we often refer to the 6 types of tea which includes 
    black tea, green tea, wulong (oolong) tea, white tea, puer (pu-erh) 
    tea, and dark tea. The Camellia sinensis plant is native to Southeast 
    Asia, but it’s now being cultivated in tea-friendly climates world-wide.  
    <br/>
   Beverages we call “herbal tea” - peppermint, rooibos, chamomile, etc. – 
   are not from the Camellia sinensis plant.  Therefore, they are not tea in 
   the technical sense (though we accept the phrase and don’t correct people 
   for using it). </p>

  <h2>Why are there so many different kinds of tea?</h2>
<p>Since all tea comes from the Camellia sinensis plant, 
  the differences between the types of tea are primarily due to 
  how they are processed after the leaves are picked.  In theory, 
  any tea plant growing anywhere can have its leaves made into any 
  kind of tea, but this is not done in practice because geography, 
  growing conditions, and local expertise are critical factors to 
  proper tea production.</p>

  <h2>Does tea contain caffeine?</h2>
<p>Yes, because all tea comes from the Camellia sinensis plant, 
  it all contains (roughly) the same amount of caffeine.  The 
  biggest determining factors of how much caffeine will be in your 
  cup is how much leaf you use, how hot you steep it, and how long 
  you steep it.</p>
  <p>“Herbal teas” are not from the Camellia sinensis plant and because 
    of this the vast majority of them are caffeine free.  These include 
    chamomile, rooibos, ginger, hibiscus, fruit tisanes, and other 
    non-camellia sinensis beverages that are steeped similar to tea.</p>

  <h2>Loose tea vs. Tea bags?</h2>
<p>We advocate for using loose leaf tea because it’s the most direct method 
  of doing tea.  It offers versatility, variety, customization, clarity, and 
  the best bang for the buck (even if that means a lot of bucks).  Tea bags 
  offer convenience.  In theory, you can offer the same tea you would buy as 
  loose tea in a tea bag (might have to be a pretty large bag), but the constraints
   of leaf size, manufacturing/marketing costs, and other factors often prevent 
   this.</p>
